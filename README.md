## replication-manager [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tanji/replication-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tanji/replication-manager)

__replication-manager__ is an high availability solution to manage MariaDB 10.x GTID replication.  

Goals are topology detection and its monitoring, to enable on-demand slave to master promotion (aka switchover), or electing a new master on failure detection (aka failover).

To perform switchover, preserving data consistency, replication-manager uses a proven mechanism similar to common MySQL failover tools such as MHA:

  * Verify replication settings
  * Check (configurable) replication on the slaves
  * Check for long running queries on master
  * Elect a new master (default to most up to date, but it could also be a designated candidate)
  * Put down the IP address on master by calling an optional script
  * Reject writes on master by calling FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK
  * Reject writes on master by setting READ_ONLY flag
  * Reject writes on master by decreasing MAX_CONNECTIONS
  * Kill pending connections on master if any remaining
  * Watching for all slaves to catch up to the current GTID position
  * Promote the candidate slave to be a new master
  * Put up the IP address on new master by calling an optional script
  * Switch other slaves and old master to be slaves of the new master and set them as read-only

__replication-manager__ is commonly used as an arbitrator and drive a proxy that routes the database traffic to the leader database node (aka the MASTER). We can advise usage of:

- A layer 7 proxy as MariaDB MaxScale that can transparently follow a newly elected topology via similar settings:

```
[MySQL Monitor]  
type=monitor  
module=mysqlmon  
servers=%%ENV:SERVERS_LIST%%  
user=root  
passwd=%%ENV:MYROOTPWD%%  
monitor_interval=500  
detect_stale_master=true

[Write Connection Router]  
type=service  
router=readconnroute  
router_options=master  
servers=%%ENV:SERVERS_LIST%%  
user=root  
passwd=%%ENV:MYROOTPWD%%  
enable_root_user=true  
```

- With monitor-less proxies, __replication-manager__ can call scripts that set and reload the new configuration of the leader route. A common scenario is an VRRP Active Passive HAProxy sharing configuration via a network disk with the __replication-manager__ scripts           
- Using __replication-manager__ as an API component of a group communication cluster. MRM can be called as a Pacemaker resource that moves alongside a VIP, the monitoring of the cluster is in this case already in charge of the GCC.

## replication-manager advantages

Leader Election Cluster is best to use in such scenarios:

   * Dysfunctional node does not impact leader performance
   * Heterogeneous node in configuration and resources does not impact leader performance
   * Leader Pick Performance is not impacted by the data replication
   * Read scalability does not impact write scalability
   * Network inter connect quality fluctuation
   * Can benefit of human expertise on false positive failure detection
   * Can benefit a minimum cluster size of two data nodes
   * Can benefit having different storage engine

This is achieved via following drawbacks:

   * Overloading the leader can lead to data loss during failover  
   * READ on replica is eventually consistent  
   * ACID can be preserved via route to leader always

Coming soon in MariaDB 10.2:

   * READ on replica can be COMMITTED READ under using semi-sync no slave behind feature


Leader Election Asynchronous Cluster can guarantee continuity of service at no cost for the leader and in some conditions with "No Data Loss", __replication-manager__ will track failover SLA (Service Level Availability).


Because it is not always desirable to perform an automatic failover in an asynchronous cluster, __replication-manager__ enforces some tunable settings to constraint the architecture state in which the failover can happen.

In the field, a regular scenario is to have long periods of time between hardware crashes: what was the state of the replication when crash happens?

We can classify SLA and failover scenario into 3 cases:

  * Replica stream in sync   
  * Replica stream not sync but state allows failover      
  * Replica stream not sync but state does not allow failover

## State: in-sync

If the replication was in sync, the failover can be done without loss of data, provided that __replication-manager__ waits for all replicated events to be applied to the elected replica, before re-opening traffic.

In order to reach this state most of the time, we advise following settings:

### Running replication at full speed

The history of MariaDB replication has reached a point that replication can almost in any case catch with the master. It can be ensured using new features like Group Commit improvement, optimistic in-order parallel replication and semi-synchronous replication.

MariaDB 10.1 settings for in-order optimistic parallel replication:

```
slave_parallel_mode = optimistic  
slave_domain_parallel_threads = %%ENV:CORES%%  
slave_parallel_threads = %%ENV:CORES%%  
expire_logs_days = 5  
sync_binlog = 1  
log_slave_updates = ON
```

### Usage of semi-synchronous replication

Semi-synchronous replication enables to delay transaction commit until the transactional event reaches at least one replica. The "In Sync" status will be lost only when a tunable replication delay is attained. This Sync status is checked by __replication-manager__ to compute the last SLA metrics, the time we may auto-failover without losing data and when we can reintroduce the dead leader without re-provisioning it.

The MariaDB recommended settings for semi-sync are the following:

```
plugin_load = "semisync_master.so;semisync_slave.so"  
rpl_semi_sync_master = ON  
rpl_semi_sync_slave = ON  
loose_rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled = ON  
loose_rpl_semi_sync_slave_enabled = ON
rpl_semi_sync_master_timeout = 10
```

Such parameters will print an expected warning in error.log on slaves about SemiSyncMaster Status switched OFF.

## State: Not in-sync & failable

__replication-manager__ can still auto failover when replication is delayed up to a reasonable time, in such case we will possibly lose data, because we are giving to HA a bigger priority compared to the quantity of possible data lost.


This is the second SLA display. This SLA tracks the time we can failover under the conditions that were predefined in the __replication-manager__ parameters, all slave delays not yet exceeded.


Probability to lose data is increased with a single slave topology, when the slave is delayed by a long running transaction or was stopped for maintenance, catching on replication events, with heavy single threaded writes process, network performance can't catch up with the leader performance.


To limit such cases we advise usage of a 3 nodes cluster that removes some of such scenarios like losing a slave.

This is the opportunity to work on long running WRITE transactions and split them in smaller chunks. Preferably we should minimize time in this state as failover would not be possible without big impact that  __replication-manager__ can force in interactive mode.  

A good practice is to enable slow query detection on slaves using in slow query log

## State: Not in-sync & unfailable

The first SLA is the one that tracks the presence of a valid topology from  __replication-manager__, when a leader is reachable but number of possible failovers exceeded, time before next failover not yet reached, no slave available to failover.

```
log_slow_slave_statements = 1
```

## Preserving data consistency inside switchover

__replication-manager__ prevents additional writes setting READ_ONLY flag on the old leader, if routers are still sending Write Transactions, they can pile-up until timeout, despite being killed by __replication-manager__.

Some additional caution to make sure that piled writes do not happen is that __replication-manager__ will decrease max_connections to the server to 1 and consume last possible connection by not killing himself. This works but to avoid a scenario where a node is left in a state where it cannot be connected anymore (crashing replication-manager in this critical section), we advise using extra port provided with MariaDB pool of threads feature:

```
thread_handling = pool-of-threads  
extra_port = 3307   
extra_max_connections = 10
```   

Also, to better protect consistency it is strongly advised to disable *SUPER* privilege to users that perform writes, such as the MaxScale user when the Read-Write split module is instructed to check for replication lag:

```
[Splitter Service]
type=service
router=readwritesplit
max_slave_replication_lag=30
```

Use the following example grant for your MaxScale user:

```
CREATE USER 'maxadmin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'maxpwd';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO 'maxadmin'@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.db TO 'maxadmin'@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.tables_priv TO 'maxadmin'@'%';
GRANT SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'maxadmin'@'%';
GRANT ALL ON maxscale_schema.* TO 'maxadmin'@'%';
```

To additional preserve the workload it is also possible to enable replication-manager to drive maxscale by putting the old leader into maintenance mode this will block the traffic upfront, and prevent any external root user to pile up writes that would have by pass read only via excessive grants    

```
--maxscale                      Synchronize replication status with MaxScale proxy server
--maxscale-host string          MaxScale host IP (default "127.0.0.1")
--maxscale-pass string          MaxScale admin password (default "mariadb")
--maxscale-port string          MaxScale admin port (default "6603")
--maxscale-user string          MaxScale admin user (default "admin")
```
During switchover all existing connection will be killed  

In switchover any slaves can be elected after it as apply all the replication events it as fetched __replication-manager__ will wait for promotion until this state.  

In failover no preferred master can be used as __replication-manager__ will check the most up to date slave. It can be done only via checking the preferred master in first candidate

## Preserving the workload during switchover

It is dangerous to Kill a long running transaction, the rollback can take as long as the time of such transaction. To validate that this will not happen __replication-manager__ can check and cancel switchover if some long running transactions are found just before the switchover. It uses FLUSH TABLE and start monitoring the time it will take to proceed, after a timeout in second (wait-trx=10) the switchover will be cancelled. If flush table can proceed under the given timeout it means that all transactions starting after can safely be killed without taking long rollback time. This connetion killed will happen under a more heavy lock FTWTL to preserve data consistency during switchover.

## Procedural command line examples

Run replication-manager in switchover mode with master host db1 and slaves db2 and db3:

`replication-manager switchover --hosts=db1,db2,db3 --user=root --rpluser=replicator --interactive`

Run replication-manager in non-interactive failover mode, using full host and port syntax, using root login for management and repl login for replication switchover, with failover scripts and added verbosity. Accept a maximum slave delay of 15 seconds before performing switchover:

`replication-manager failover --hosts=db1:3306,db2:3306,db2:3306 --user=root:pass --rpluser=repl:pass --pre-failover-script="/usr/local/bin/vipdown.sh" -post-failover-script="/usr/local/bin/vipup.sh" --verbose --maxdelay=15`

## Monitoring

Start replication-manager in console mode to monitor the cluster:

`replication-manager monitor --hosts=db1:3306,db2:3306,db2:3306 --user=root:pass --rpluser=repl:pass`

![mrmconsole](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/971260/16738035/45f2bbf2-4794-11e6-8286-65f9a3179e31.png)

The console mode accepts several commands:

```
Ctrl-D  Print debug information
Ctrl-F  Manual Failover
Ctrl-I  Toggle automatic/manual failover mode
Ctrl-R  Set slaves read-only
Ctrl-S  Switchover
Ctrl-Q  Quit
Ctrl-W  Set slaves read-write
```

Start replication-manager in background to monitor the cluster, using the http server to control the daemon

`replication-manager monitor --hosts=db1:3306,db2:3306,db2:3306 --user=root:pass --rpluser=repl:pass --daemon --http-server`

The http server is accessible on http://localhost:10001 by default, and looks like this:

![mrmdash](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/971260/16737848/807d6106-4793-11e6-9e65-cd86fdca3b68.png)

The http dashboard is an experimental angularjs application, please don't use it in production as it has no protected access for now (or use creativity to restrict access to it).

Start replication-manager in automatic daemon mode:

`replication-manager monitor --hosts=db1:3306,db2:3306,db2:3306 --user=root:pass --rpluser=repl:pass --daemon --interactive=false`

This mode is similar to the normal console mode with the exception of automated master failovers. With this mode, it is possible to run the replication-manager as a daemon process that manages a database cluster. Note that the `--interactive=false` option is required with the `--daemon` option to make the failovers automatic. Without it, the daemon only passively monitors the cluster.

## Available commands

```
  agent       Starts replication monitoring agent
  bootstrap   Bootstrap a replication environment
  failover    Failover a dead master
  keygen      Generate a new encryption key

## Configuration file

All the options above are settable in a configuration file that must be located in `/etc/replication-manager/config.toml`. Check `etc/config.toml.sample` in the repository for syntax examples.

Management user (given by the --user option) and Replication user (given by the --repluser option) need to be given privileges to the host from which `replication-manager` runs. Users with wildcards are accepted as well.

The management user needs at least the following privileges: `SUPER`, `REPLICATION CLIENT` and `RELOAD`

The replication user needs the following privilege: `REPLICATION SLAVE`

## Default failover workflow in monitoring mode

After checking the leader multiple times via the server protocol COM_PING  (failcount=5), replication-manager will send an alert email and put itself in waiting mode.

This default was done for maximum confidence in deploying the tool, we wait for a user to completes the failover or leader self-heals. This mode is know as the On-call mode (interactive = true).

When failover is triggered, conditions for a possible failover are checked. Per default
- The slave was connected to the failed leader
- The SQL thread is running so the slave was not stopped
- The slave reply to PING_COM protocol
- The IO_thread should be in connecting or stopped on all slaves (split brain detection from replication-manager to the master)

Extra checks are disabled but are defined in the configuration template and advised to set:
- Exceeding a given replication delay (maxdelay=0)
- Failover did not happen previously in less than a given time interval (failover-time-limit=0)  
- Failover limit was not reached (failover-limit=0)

A user can force switchover or failover on a late or stopped slave by ignoring those checks via the (rplchecks=false) flag or via the console "Replication Checks Change" button.

Semi-Sync replication status is not checked during failover, but this check can be enforced with semi- sync replication to enable to preserve OLD LEADER recovery at all costs, and do not failover if none of the slaves are in SYNC status.

- Last semi sync status was SYNC  (failsync=false)  

A user can change this check based on what is reported by SLA in sync, and decide that most of the time the replication is in sync and when it's not, that the failover should be manual. Via http console use "Failover Sync" button


## Multi-master

`replication-manager` supports 2-node multi-master topology detection. It is required to specify it explictely in `replication-manager` configuration, you just need to set one preferred master and one very important parameter in MariaDB configuration file.  

```
read_only = 1
```

This flag ensures that in case of split brain + leader crash, when old leader is reintroduced it will not show up as a possible leader for WRITES.

MaxScale can follow multi=master setting by tracking the read-only flag and route queries to the writable node.

```    
[Multi-Master Monitor]
type=monitor
module=mmmon
servers=server1,server2,server3
user=myuser
passwd=mypwd
detect_stale_master=true
```

## System requirements

`replication-manager` is a self-contained binary, which means that no dependencies are needed at the operating system level.
On the MariaDB side, slaves need to use GTID for replication. Old-style positional replication is not supported (yet).
